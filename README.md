# UnityTriangleSplatting

## Introduction

**UnityTriangleSplatting** is a Unity package for visualizing triangle splats from COFF files, inspired by the [Triangle Splatting](https://github.com/trianglesplatting/triangle-splatting) project. It supports chunked loading, frustum culling, and optional mesh collider generation for interactive exploration of large triangle datasets.

## Features

- Load and render `.off` (COFF) triangle files  
- Chunk-based loading for performance  
- Frustum culling for real-time optimization  
- Optional mesh collider generation  
- Vertex color support for per-vertex shading
